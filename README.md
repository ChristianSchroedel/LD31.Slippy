# Let's eat!
### The small penguin named Slippy is hungry!
Luckily there are plenty of fish on the ice, but watch out, it might be a bit slippery out there.
Of course this is not a problem at all for such a great penguin as Slippy.

### Help him to get some delicous fish and make him happy!

If you can fetch some of those fishes you get rewarded with some delicous points. How many points can you get in 60 seconds?!?

### But behold! Not everything on the ice looks as tasty ...

Better do not eat those ... gross, dirty, untasty things someone lost on the ice ...
You will make Slippy sad and lose some points ...
